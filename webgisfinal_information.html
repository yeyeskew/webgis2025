  <h3 class="p-pad">Study Information</h3>

  <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
  
  <p class="p-pad">
    We chose to study the 10 metro systems in North America with the highest annual ridership numbers. We  then mapped these metro systems with ArcGIS Online. 
  </p>
  
  <p class="p-pad">
    In our study, we determined that dividing the average annual ridership by system length in kilometers to keep it internationally standard. We gathered data from city amd university level research for our metrics for population, ridership, and our shapefiles.
  </p>

  <p class="p-pad">
    This formula comes out to be AR (Annual Ridership) / SL (System Length in kilometers) = EC (Efficiency Coefficient).
  </p>

  <p class="p-pad">
    The higher the EC of a city, the higher the ridership per rail kilometer. This gives a rough estimate of how well utilized a system is instead of looking at the raw numbers of a system and comparing those. 
  </p>

  <p class="p-pad">
    While there are many other variables that contribute to ridership (such as metro area population), those were not taken into consideration because a larger metro population will automatically correlate to some higher level of ridership over a smaller city. 
  </p>

  <h3 class="p-pad">
    8. Washington, D.C., USA.
  </h3>
  <p class="p-pad">
    EC of 801,221 riders/km
  </p>


  <h3 class="p-pad">
    9. Chicago, IL, USA.
  </h3>
 <p class="p-pad">
    EC of 770,637 riders/km
  </p>

  
  <h3 class="p-pad">
    10. San Francisco, CA, USA.
  </h3>
    <p class="p-pad">
    EC of 240,151 riders/km
  </p>

  <div class="horizontal2"></div>

  <h3 class="p-pad">
    While most of our cities stayed at the same rank in population and EC value, Monterrey and Boston moved up on the EC rankings. This was made possible by D.C. and Chicago both moving down. 
  </h3>

  <p class="p-pad">
    This could be due to the fact that Chicago and Washington D.C. have lots of connections out to the suburbs of Naperville, Cicero, and Aurora for Chicago and Alexandria, College Park, and Arlington for D.C.
  </p>

  <p class="p-pad">
    These suburban areas typically have a very low population density, which inherently produces a lower EC because of fewer people having access to the entire metro network.
  </p>

  <p class="p-pad">
    As I mentioned, population density of a metro area has a large effect on the EC value of a city, likely leading to the trend of Canadian and Mexican cities outside of New York topping the list.
  </p>

    <div class="horizontal2"></div>
  
  <h3 class="p-pad">
    If we were to do this study again, a good measure to counter this would be to include the population density of a metro area in the numerator of the formula for EC.
  </h3>

  <p class="p-pad">
    This would make the new formula (AR / Pop. Density) / SL = EC.
